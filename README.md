- <a href="https://www.postman.com/vlapp-emmerce/workspace/graffix-workspace/collection/26841432-c5a587c9-e394-4442-a479-64102c0791b1?action=share&creator=26841432&active-environment=26841432-d174213c-8355-4d3a-9cc9-5ea6d8f19baf" target="_blank">POSTMAN Workspace</a>

This project is a Node.js application that utilizes the Prisma ORM to interact with a MySQL database. This project is part of a backend development assessment exercise for a hiring agency system. It focuses on tracking job opportunities and applicants, providing a robust and efficient backend built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma. The system allows for managing job openings, applicant details, and job applications.

This was achieved through 4 models (JobCategories, Jobs, Applicants, and Applications), and also the 5th User model for the purpose of Authentication.

### Key Features Done: ‚úÖ


#### Required

* Job Openings Management: API endpoints to add, list, update and update job openings, and storing details in MYSQL database.
* Applicant Tracking: Capabilities to register, list, update, and delete applicants including personal details, job applications, and resume links, and save to MYSQL database.

* Applicant and Job Details Retrieval: Full CRUD actions Endpoints to fetch and display lists of applicants and the jobs they have applied for.


#### Optional functionality

-- Following are implemented to enhance security

  * UUID as Primary Key - UUID consists of 32 hex digits separated by four dashes, which makes it quite challenging to remember. At some level this relieves the vulnerability of data manipulation.

  * Authentication - signup and login helps protect all routes used in this API. You have to be registered in the system through sign up, so then you can access login, and eventually through login you can have access to all other endpoints.  

  * JWTs - JSON Web Tokens implementation makes the API secure because they contain a signature that can be verified to ensure validity. 


  * Password Encryption using Bcrypt - Bcrypt encryption of passoword is essential because it the password is saved in the db in a salted format. 



#### General Overview
* Applicants Management: ...

* Jobs Management: ...

* Express.js Web Server: The application is built using Express.js, providing a web server for handling API requests.

* Prisma ORM: Prisma is used as the ORM to interact with the MySQL database, making it easy to work with your data models.

This project provides a solid foundation for building a web application that manages user and perfume data. You can easily extend and customize it to suit your specific requirements.



## Consuming API Endpoints with Postman üßê

### Setting Up / Signup
1. Open this <a href="https://www.postman.com/vlapp-emmerce/workspace/graffix-workspace/collection/26841432-c5a587c9-e394-4442-a479-64102c0791b1?action=share&creator=26841432&active-environment=26841432-d174213c-8355-4d3a-9cc9-5ea6d8f19baf" target="_blank">POSTMAN Workspace</a> on your device
2. Open the Auth Folder and click on POST Register New User. Fill in the request body with your chosen email and password in JSON format:
    ```
    {
      "email": "yours@example.com",
      "password": "your-password"
    }
    ```
3. Send the request by clicking the "Send" button

### Login and Retrieve Token

1. Click on "POST Login User" under the "Auth" collection
2. Enter the same email and password you registered with in the request body.
3. Send the request. You will receive a JSON response with a Bearer token. Copy this token.

### Set the Bearer Token
1. Click on the "Auth" collection in the sidebar Select the "Authorization" tab in the right-hand pane.
2. Set the type to "Bearer Token".
3. Paste the copied token into the "Token" field. Click "Save".


Your token is now set for all requests within the "Auth" collection. Since the token expires after 30 minutes, you may need to log in again to refresh the token if it expires.

You can now Consume all Other Endpoints in the Postman Workspace
